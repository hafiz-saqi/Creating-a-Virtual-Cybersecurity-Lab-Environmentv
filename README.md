## 🔐 Task 2: Cyber Threat Analysis

### 1. Common Cyber Threats
- **Phishing:** Fraudulent attempts to steal sensitive information by impersonation
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts user files and demands payment for decryption
- **Malware:** Malicious software designed to damage or exploit systems
- **DDoS:** Floods systems with traffic to disrupt services
- **SQL Injection:** Exploits input fields to access backend databases

---

### 2. How These Threats Are Used in Attacks
- **Phishing:** Fake emails and messages trick users into revealing credentials
- **Ransomware:** Spread via malicious attachments and exploit kits
- **Malware:** Delivered through infected downloads or compromised websites
- **DDoS:** Botnets overwhelm targeted systems with traffic
- **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL queries manipulate application databases

---

### 3. Real-World Cyber Threat Examples
- **Phishing:** Banking sector breaches due to credential harvesting
- **Ransomware:** Ragnar Locker attacks on energy and enterprise organizations
- **Malware:** NotPetya attack caused billions in global damages
- **DDoS:** Surge in attacks on remote work infrastructure during COVID-19
- **SQL Injection:** Heartland Payment Systems breach exposing credit card data
